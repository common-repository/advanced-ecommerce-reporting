Neatly WooCommerce Extension
============================

Getting Started

  To get started with the Neatly WooCommerce extension, copy this folder to the plugins folder of your wordpress installation
  and then enable the plugin. This should now make an extra "option" to set in the WooCommerce settings. We'll go there to
  verify that all has installed okay. Navigate to WooCommerce > Settings > General and enter the token that has been given
  to you by Neatly in that text box and say "Hook Me Up" - all should then be set up after you enter your store URL. If you
  don't have a token, go to [Neatly](https://neatly.io) to connect WooCommerce to your company.
